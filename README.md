# Vehicle Speed Monitoring and Fault Logging System

## Project Overview

This project simulates a vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to monitor vehicle speed and log faults based on certain conditions. The system generates logs for high-speed faults, idle faults, and other potential issues in the vehicle's operation. This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as an example of how automotive software testing and simulation can be performed.

## Features

- Simulates a vehicle's speed monitoring system.
- Logs faults (e.g., high speed, idle faults).
- Implements basic fault logging to a CSV file.
- Automated testing using `pytest` to ensure correct functionality.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pytest` (for running tests)
